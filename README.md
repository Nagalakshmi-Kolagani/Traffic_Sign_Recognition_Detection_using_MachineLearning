# Traffic_Sign_Recognition_Detection_with_Flask_And_MachineLearning

We have done Our Project in two steps:-

1. Traffic Sign Recognition

Here we have using Convolution Neural Networks to train our data. We have taken German Dataset from Kaggle.A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a specific type of artificial neural network that uses perceptrons, a machine learning unit algorithm, for supervised learning, to analyze data. CNNs apply to image processing, natural language processing and other kinds of cognitive tasks.

2. Traffic Sign Detection

In this step we have used Detectron2 library provided by pytorch.Labelled our images using labelmg.We loaded the data from the csv file, which We created with the xml_to_csv.py file based on the xml_to_csv.py file. Detectron2 is Facebook's new vision library that allows us to easily use and create object detection, instance segmentation, keypoint detection, and panoptic segmentation models. It has a simple, modular design that makes it easy to rewrite a script for another data-set.
